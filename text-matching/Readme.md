## Building a text matching algorithm for question retrieval

### Coding
1. Implementation of building a text matching algorithm for question retrieval is located in `main.ipynb`
2. Algorithms:
    1. Inverted index with TF-IDF
    2. Sentence Embedding with Averaging Word Embeddings
   3. A Simple but tough-to-beat Baseline for Sentence Embeddings
   
### Instruction
1. To run the SearchQuestion.py open a terminal and run the following command
```
   Python SearchQuestion.py "<question>"
   Example:
      Python SearchQuestion.py "What can one do after MBBS?"
```
